# Research Question(s)
How can we adapt text-to-image transformers to manipulate calligraphic imagery input? [Work in progress]

# Critical Theory
Inclusivity of Machine Learning research / Technological tools affordances not fitting the Arabic script (Having to modify the script to fit the tool rather than other way round) / How to adapt or expand?

# Initial Description
My research involves creating an artistic tool that integrates machine learning and Arabic calligraphy and/or lettering. The idea is currently still abstract; however, I want to create a design tool for calligraphers that allows them to utilize the power of ML rather than a tool that generates calligraphy from scratch. As a lettering artist myself, I would like to bring lettering strokes to life maybe through sound or by transforming flat letters to something more intricate and multi-dimensional. The aim of this research is twofold, starting with expanding the traditional artistâ€™s creative kit while simultaneously seeking to integrate novel applications of ML within the creative field in my region, the Middle East.
